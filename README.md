# Vocabtester

This is a project I wrote in c++ just before I wrote the database 'engine' at https://github.com/millerthegorilla/cplusplusdbase

I am a qualified and experienced TESOL teacher, and so have an interest in augmenting student techniques to learn vocabulary.

From memory Vocabtester has a variety of different tools, including a wordsearch generator.

The project was written using visual C++ 6.0, and so I doubt I will get around to compiling it any time soon to find out precisely what is in it...

As with all my code, it is presented here with an MIT license.
